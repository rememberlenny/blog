					<description><![CDATA[A few personal updates. Today is my 33rd birthday, and in somewhat abrupt fashion, I am moving to San Francisco. It feels particularly significant for the reasons I’ll mention below.&#160; First, about three months ago, I began a conversation with a senior individual at a company,&#160;OpenAI, I had been following in the&#160;artificial general intelligence (AGI)&#160;space.

I didn’t think as much about what turning 30 meant last year, so taking a pause to write down some thoughts about the last 10 years, and the next 10.
